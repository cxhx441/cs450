# CS450 Introduction to Computer Graphics

This is my working repo used throughout my CS450 term. The class mainly taught the basics of OpenGL.

## [Final Project](https://github.com/cxhx441/cs450/tree/main/final_turn_in)
My final project was a recreation of the opening title of the 1991 video game *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*. The main folder can be found [here](https://github.com/cxhx441/cs450/tree/main/final_turn_in)

The project is primarly written in C++ and OpenGL and utilizes template files written by the professor.

- The triforce pieces, text, sky, and sparkles are all modeled from scratch in Blender.
- The sword and castle models were freely available online and were edited in Blender.
- The mountain terrain, hills terrain, and water are all created within the code using shaders.
- Textures were applied to the sky and castle.
- Coloring and lighting is mostly handled through the vertex and fragment shaders.
- Model movement and lighting effects (gleam on sword) is handled using Keytimes objects.
- The water movement is handled in the vertex, geometry, and fragment shaders.
